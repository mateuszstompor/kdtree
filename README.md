Repository contains Ruby implementation of space partitioning tree data structure. It is a form of binary tree and its detailed description can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree).

# Approach
The Tree was implemented in TDD approach. There are many simple, easy to read tests implemented with help of MiniTest gem. 

# Installation
###### Offline installation
* Download or clone repository
* Navigate to the root folder of the project
* Build gem with command:
```bash
    $ gem build kd_tree.gemspec
```
* Install gem in search paths
```bash
    $ gem install kd_tree_ms-x.x.x.gem
```
Where "x.x.x" is a version number

###### Online installation with ruby gem
It is not available at the moment, you will be able to install gem when it becomes fully stable

# Usage
```ruby
    # First of all you have to import the library to your project
    require 'kd_tre≈≥e_ms'

    # Create an empty tree of dimension 2
    tree = Kd::Tree.new 2

    # Insert value to the tree
    # Provide coordinates
    # As an example let's take [0, 1] where 0 is x and 1 is y coordinate
    tree.insert [0, 1], 'some_value'

    # You can delete a value which you have inserted before
    tree.delete 'some_value'

    # You can check if the tree is empty
    tree.empty?

    # Check if it includes a value which you are looking for
    tree.include? 'some_value' 

    # Clear an existing tree
    tree.clear 

    # Retrieve data from a tree
    # Supply amount of ranges equivalent to the dimension of a tree 
    tree.retrieve [0..2, -1..2] 

    # Check the dimension of a tree
    tree.dimension

    # It is possible to check its size as well
    tree.size
```
